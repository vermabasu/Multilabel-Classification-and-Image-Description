# Multilabel-Classification-and-Image-Description

We have build a model for Multilabel image Classification, Multimodal Image Clas-
sification and Image Description. Provided data was Pascal50s and abstract50S and
we needed to classify the image into given set of multilabels and also to generate a
sentence describing about the given image.



In this project we did multi-label object classification from the images given and it’s de-
scription given in 50 lines into 20 predefined labels. Multi-label classification involves
predicting zero or more class labels. Unlike normal classification tasks where class la-
bels are mutually exclusive, multi-label classification requires specialized deep learning
algorithms that support predicting multiple mutually non-exclusive classes or “labels.”
Also in this project a model is made and trained on a given data so as to produce
textual description when fed an image data. Pretrained ImageNet and VGG16 models
as well custom made models are used to achieve the desired results.
